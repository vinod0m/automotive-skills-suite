# Autonomous Daily Run Log

_Maintained by `automotive-skills-daily-standup` scheduled task._

## 2026-05-11 (autonomous run, PLAN)

**Mode:** PLAN
**Action:** Generated STATUS.md, picked 4 weekly polish targets, wrote docs/weekly/WEEK-2026-W20.md, opened paired GitHub issues #3–#6.
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated, full builder × reviewer pairing table)
- `docs/weekly/WEEK-2026-W20.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (after applying the two known aliases: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer` and `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (was 1 — the four `weekly-target` issues opened today + the pre-existing untriaged #2 "goodd")
**Notes:** Quiet baseline: no commits in the past 7 days; the suite is sitting at its initial 152-skill seed. STATUS.md showed 100% pairing once the two aliases were honored, so no orphan list this week. Target selection fell out of the least-recently-touched bucket (everything in it was touched on 2026-05-01), and I deliberately picked one builder from each of safety / cyber / aspice / quality rather than draining a single domain. Skipped trying to also touch `.skill` content today — PLAN mode produces the plan and the issues, not the edits. Issue #2 ("goodd") is intentionally left untouched until Sunday's TRIAGE.
**Follow-ups:**
- Tue–Thu (POLISH): work issues #3–#6 in order, one per day, with `docs/skill-polish-log/<name>.md` notes per the task spec.
- Next PLAN (W21): explicitly pull at least one target from comms / autosar / diagnostics / calibration to rebalance the rotation.
- Bake the two builder↔reviewer aliases into a `.skill-aliases` map if a third alias ever appears, so STATUS generation isn't tripping on naming drift.
- Issue #2 "goodd" still needs human attention or Sunday TRIAGE labeling (currently too vague to label with ≥80% confidence).


## 2026-05-12 (autonomous run, POLISH)

**Mode:** POLISH
**Action:** Regenerated STATUS.md and ran first POLISH pass on `hara-builder.skill` (W20 issue #3). Wrote `docs/skill-polish-log/hara-builder.md` with three low-severity findings and a drafted ≤1024-char description rewrite. No `.skill` edits applied — none of the findings matched the autonomous-edit allowlist (typo / over-length / missing required field).
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated — domain classifier fixed to route `dia/fmeda/hsi/item-definition` to **safety** instead of `other`; was 4 "other" rows yesterday, now 0)
- `docs/skill-polish-log/hara-builder.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (aliases honored: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer`, `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3–#6 the W20 weekly targets — unchanged from yesterday)
**Notes:** POLISH priority order ran through: no `skill-bug` / `reviewer-finding` issues open, no orphan builders, so I fell to least-recently-touched and picked issue #3's target (`hara-builder.skill`) — which is also W20-target #1 by design. The skill is in good shape overall (911-char description, clean YAML frontmatter, mentor-quality common-mistakes section); the only DoD gap is that the phrase "safety goal" first appears at char ~506 instead of the asked-for first-400-char window. A drafted rewrite is in the polish log and is **not** auto-applied because the spec restricts autonomous edits to typo / length / missing-field fixes, and this is editorial re-ordering. Two side benefits of today's STATUS regeneration: caught and fixed a domain-classifier bug (4 skills were labeled `other`), and confirmed the 100% paired-ratio assertion from yesterday's PLAN entry holds.
**Follow-ups:**
- Tomorrow (Wed): POLISH issue #4 — `cs-concept-builder.skill`. Same playbook.
- Human review: if the proposed `hara-builder` description rewrite looks right, ship it as a manual commit and close #3. If it doesn't, leave a comment on #3 and I'll re-touch with the corrected direction next week.
- Future hardening: bake the four extra safety-domain prefixes (`dia/fmeda/hsi/item-definition`) into a constants file so the classifier doesn't drift again on the next regeneration script tweak.
- Issue #2 ("goodd") still needs Sunday TRIAGE — still too low-confidence to label.


## 2026-05-13 (autonomous run, POLISH)

**Mode:** POLISH
**Action:** Regenerated STATUS.md and ran second POLISH pass on `cs-concept-builder.skill` (W20 issue #4). Wrote `docs/skill-polish-log/cs-concept-builder.md` with four low-severity findings and a drafted ≤1024-char description rewrite. No `.skill` edits applied — none of the findings matched the autonomous-edit allowlist (typo / over-length / missing required field).
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated — only the header date changed; classifier produced byte-identical body to yesterday's, confirming the prefix ordering fix for `safety-program-` / `safety-gate-` → `program-mgmt` is now stable)
- `docs/skill-polish-log/cs-concept-builder.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (aliases honored: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer`, `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3–#6 W20 weekly targets — unchanged from yesterday)
**Notes:** POLISH priority order ran the same as Tuesday: no `skill-bug` / `reviewer-finding` issues open, no orphan builders, so the next W20 issue (#4 `cs-concept-builder.skill`) was the target. The skill is in genuinely good shape — AAICAN list correct and complete in canonical order inside the first 400 chars (the DoD "accuracy" check); 784/1024 description chars with ~240 chars of headroom; mentor-quality common-pitfalls section; upstream/downstream pipeline linkage (cs-goals-builder → here → CSI) named explicitly. Findings are all low-severity trigger-coverage gaps: `CAL allocation` absent, `CSR derivation` at char 607 (outside the asked-for 400-char window), casual framings thin, and `CSI handoff` only present with the parenthetical gloss. A drafted rewrite is in the polish log; not auto-applied because editorial trigger-reordering is outside the autonomous-edit allowlist. This is now the **second consecutive POLISH finding** with the same shape — AAICAN/HARA fundamentals fine, but one or two formal trigger phrases land past the 400-char threshold. Calling it out in the follow-ups for the W21 PLAN to consider a suite-wide DoD audit rather than per-skill chasing.
**Follow-ups:**
- Tomorrow (Thu): POLISH issue #5 — `aspice-assessment-builder.skill`. Confirm the 13-tab list in the description matches the actual builder schema, and trigger list mentions both v3.1 and v4.0.
- **Suite-wide pattern emerging:** two-for-two POLISH passes have flagged "formal trigger phrase outside first 400 chars" as the dominant finding. W21 PLAN should consider scripting a once-per-week DoD audit across all 76 builders that emits a shortlist of "descriptions where the canonical trigger phrase falls past char 400", instead of catching one per Tuesday.
- Human review: if the proposed `cs-concept-builder` description rewrite looks right, ship it as a manual commit and close #4. Same posture as #3 from yesterday.
- Issue #2 ("goodd") still needs Sunday TRIAGE — still too low-confidence to label.


## 2026-05-14 (autonomous run, POLISH)

**Mode:** POLISH
**Action:** Regenerated STATUS.md and ran third POLISH pass on `aspice-assessment-builder.skill` (W20 issue #5). Wrote `docs/skill-polish-log/aspice-assessment-builder.md` with the DoD verdict, four low-severity findings, and a drafted ≤1024-char description rewrite. No `.skill` edits applied — none of the findings matched the autonomous-edit allowlist (typo / over-length / missing required field).
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated — no skill files changed since 2026-05-13: same 152 files, same git last-touched dates, same classifier + alias map, so the body is byte-identical and only the generation-date header advanced)
- `docs/skill-polish-log/aspice-assessment-builder.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (aliases honored: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer`, `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3–#6 W20 weekly targets — unchanged from yesterday)
**Notes:** POLISH priority order ran the same as Tue/Wed: no `skill-bug` / `reviewer-finding` issues open, and STATUS shows no true orphan builders (the two known naming aliases are honored), so the next W20 issue (#5 `aspice-assessment-builder.skill`) was the target. **DoD check 1 passes cleanly** — I diffed the SKILL.md "Output structure (13 tabs)" table against the `tabs` list in `scripts/generate_aspice_assessment.py` and all 13 entries match one-for-one in order, and the frontmatter's "Produces 13 tabs including ..." enumeration names only real tabs with a correct count. **DoD check 2 is a partial miss** — v3.1/v4.0 appear in the description's opening clause but not in the "Use this skill whenever..." trigger list. Two side findings: the bundled `references/` files are never read by any workflow step, and there is no v4.0 reference file despite the v3.1/v4.0 claim. A drafted description rewrite is in the polish log; not auto-applied because trigger-reordering is editorial, outside the allowlist. This is now the **third consecutive POLISH pass** flagging the same shape (fundamentals sound, one formal trigger phrase outside the active trigger list).
**Follow-ups:**
- Tomorrow (Fri) is DOCS mode, not POLISH — issue #6 (`8d-problem-solving-builder.skill`, the last W20 target) will not get an autonomous POLISH pass this week. Flagging so the W21 PLAN either re-lists it or a human picks it up; otherwise #6 closes the week unworked.
- **Suite-wide pattern confirmed (3/3):** every POLISH pass this week — #3 hara ("safety goal"), #4 cs-concept ("CSR derivation"/"CAL allocation"), #5 aspice ("v3.1/v4.0") — found a canonical trigger phrase living outside the active trigger list. W21 PLAN should make a scripted once-per-week trigger-coverage audit across all 76 builders a first-class target instead of catching one per Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday.
- Human review: if the proposed `aspice-assessment-builder` description rewrite looks right, ship it as a manual commit and close #5. Same posture as #3/#4.
- Repackaging note for a human pass: `aspice-assessment-builder.skill` carries a stray empty `.placeholder` file and is missing a v4.0 reference doc — both worth fixing the next time the archive is rebuilt.
- Issue #2 ("goodd") still needs Sunday TRIAGE — still too low-confidence to label.

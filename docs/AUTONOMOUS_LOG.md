# Autonomous Daily Run Log

_Maintained by `automotive-skills-daily-standup` scheduled task._

## 2026-05-11 (autonomous run, PLAN)

**Mode:** PLAN
**Action:** Generated STATUS.md, picked 4 weekly polish targets, wrote docs/weekly/WEEK-2026-W20.md, opened paired GitHub issues #3–#6.
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated, full builder × reviewer pairing table)
- `docs/weekly/WEEK-2026-W20.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (after applying the two known aliases: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer` and `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (was 1 — the four `weekly-target` issues opened today + the pre-existing untriaged #2 "goodd")
**Notes:** Quiet baseline: no commits in the past 7 days; the suite is sitting at its initial 152-skill seed. STATUS.md showed 100% pairing once the two aliases were honored, so no orphan list this week. Target selection fell out of the least-recently-touched bucket (everything in it was touched on 2026-05-01), and I deliberately picked one builder from each of safety / cyber / aspice / quality rather than draining a single domain. Skipped trying to also touch `.skill` content today — PLAN mode produces the plan and the issues, not the edits. Issue #2 ("goodd") is intentionally left untouched until Sunday's TRIAGE.
**Follow-ups:**
- Tue–Thu (POLISH): work issues #3–#6 in order, one per day, with `docs/skill-polish-log/<name>.md` notes per the task spec.
- Next PLAN (W21): explicitly pull at least one target from comms / autosar / diagnostics / calibration to rebalance the rotation.
- Bake the two builder↔reviewer aliases into a `.skill-aliases` map if a third alias ever appears, so STATUS generation isn't tripping on naming drift.
- Issue #2 "goodd" still needs human attention or Sunday TRIAGE labeling (currently too vague to label with ≥80% confidence).


## 2026-05-12 (autonomous run, POLISH)

**Mode:** POLISH
**Action:** Regenerated STATUS.md and ran first POLISH pass on `hara-builder.skill` (W20 issue #3). Wrote `docs/skill-polish-log/hara-builder.md` with three low-severity findings and a drafted ≤1024-char description rewrite. No `.skill` edits applied — none of the findings matched the autonomous-edit allowlist (typo / over-length / missing required field).
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated — domain classifier fixed to route `dia/fmeda/hsi/item-definition` to **safety** instead of `other`; was 4 "other" rows yesterday, now 0)
- `docs/skill-polish-log/hara-builder.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (aliases honored: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer`, `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3–#6 the W20 weekly targets — unchanged from yesterday)
**Notes:** POLISH priority order ran through: no `skill-bug` / `reviewer-finding` issues open, no orphan builders, so I fell to least-recently-touched and picked issue #3's target (`hara-builder.skill`) — which is also W20-target #1 by design. The skill is in good shape overall (911-char description, clean YAML frontmatter, mentor-quality common-mistakes section); the only DoD gap is that the phrase "safety goal" first appears at char ~506 instead of the asked-for first-400-char window. A drafted rewrite is in the polish log and is **not** auto-applied because the spec restricts autonomous edits to typo / length / missing-field fixes, and this is editorial re-ordering. Two side benefits of today's STATUS regeneration: caught and fixed a domain-classifier bug (4 skills were labeled `other`), and confirmed the 100% paired-ratio assertion from yesterday's PLAN entry holds.
**Follow-ups:**
- Tomorrow (Wed): POLISH issue #4 — `cs-concept-builder.skill`. Same playbook.
- Human review: if the proposed `hara-builder` description rewrite looks right, ship it as a manual commit and close #3. If it doesn't, leave a comment on #3 and I'll re-touch with the corrected direction next week.
- Future hardening: bake the four extra safety-domain prefixes (`dia/fmeda/hsi/item-definition`) into a constants file so the classifier doesn't drift again on the next regeneration script tweak.
- Issue #2 ("goodd") still needs Sunday TRIAGE — still too low-confidence to label.


## 2026-05-13 (autonomous run, POLISH)

**Mode:** POLISH
**Action:** Regenerated STATUS.md and ran second POLISH pass on `cs-concept-builder.skill` (W20 issue #4). Wrote `docs/skill-polish-log/cs-concept-builder.md` with four low-severity findings and a drafted ≤1024-char description rewrite. No `.skill` edits applied — none of the findings matched the autonomous-edit allowlist (typo / over-length / missing required field).
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated — only the header date changed; classifier produced byte-identical body to yesterday's, confirming the prefix ordering fix for `safety-program-` / `safety-gate-` → `program-mgmt` is now stable)
- `docs/skill-polish-log/cs-concept-builder.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (aliases honored: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer`, `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3–#6 W20 weekly targets — unchanged from yesterday)
**Notes:** POLISH priority order ran the same as Tuesday: no `skill-bug` / `reviewer-finding` issues open, no orphan builders, so the next W20 issue (#4 `cs-concept-builder.skill`) was the target. The skill is in genuinely good shape — AAICAN list correct and complete in canonical order inside the first 400 chars (the DoD "accuracy" check); 784/1024 description chars with ~240 chars of headroom; mentor-quality common-pitfalls section; upstream/downstream pipeline linkage (cs-goals-builder → here → CSI) named explicitly. Findings are all low-severity trigger-coverage gaps: `CAL allocation` absent, `CSR derivation` at char 607 (outside the asked-for 400-char window), casual framings thin, and `CSI handoff` only present with the parenthetical gloss. A drafted rewrite is in the polish log; not auto-applied because editorial trigger-reordering is outside the autonomous-edit allowlist. This is now the **second consecutive POLISH finding** with the same shape — AAICAN/HARA fundamentals fine, but one or two formal trigger phrases land past the 400-char threshold. Calling it out in the follow-ups for the W21 PLAN to consider a suite-wide DoD audit rather than per-skill chasing.
**Follow-ups:**
- Tomorrow (Thu): POLISH issue #5 — `aspice-assessment-builder.skill`. Confirm the 13-tab list in the description matches the actual builder schema, and trigger list mentions both v3.1 and v4.0.
- **Suite-wide pattern emerging:** two-for-two POLISH passes have flagged "formal trigger phrase outside first 400 chars" as the dominant finding. W21 PLAN should consider scripting a once-per-week DoD audit across all 76 builders that emits a shortlist of "descriptions where the canonical trigger phrase falls past char 400", instead of catching one per Tuesday.
- Human review: if the proposed `cs-concept-builder` description rewrite looks right, ship it as a manual commit and close #4. Same posture as #3 from yesterday.
- Issue #2 ("goodd") still needs Sunday TRIAGE — still too low-confidence to label.


## 2026-05-14 (autonomous run, POLISH)

**Mode:** POLISH
**Action:** Regenerated STATUS.md and ran third POLISH pass on `aspice-assessment-builder.skill` (W20 issue #5). Wrote `docs/skill-polish-log/aspice-assessment-builder.md` with the DoD verdict, four low-severity findings, and a drafted ≤1024-char description rewrite. No `.skill` edits applied — none of the findings matched the autonomous-edit allowlist (typo / over-length / missing required field).
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated — no skill files changed since 2026-05-13: same 152 files, same git last-touched dates, same classifier + alias map, so the body is byte-identical and only the generation-date header advanced)
- `docs/skill-polish-log/aspice-assessment-builder.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (aliases honored: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer`, `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3–#6 W20 weekly targets — unchanged from yesterday)
**Notes:** POLISH priority order ran the same as Tue/Wed: no `skill-bug` / `reviewer-finding` issues open, and STATUS shows no true orphan builders (the two known naming aliases are honored), so the next W20 issue (#5 `aspice-assessment-builder.skill`) was the target. **DoD check 1 passes cleanly** — I diffed the SKILL.md "Output structure (13 tabs)" table against the `tabs` list in `scripts/generate_aspice_assessment.py` and all 13 entries match one-for-one in order, and the frontmatter's "Produces 13 tabs including ..." enumeration names only real tabs with a correct count. **DoD check 2 is a partial miss** — v3.1/v4.0 appear in the description's opening clause but not in the "Use this skill whenever..." trigger list. Two side findings: the bundled `references/` files are never read by any workflow step, and there is no v4.0 reference file despite the v3.1/v4.0 claim. A drafted description rewrite is in the polish log; not auto-applied because trigger-reordering is editorial, outside the allowlist. This is now the **third consecutive POLISH pass** flagging the same shape (fundamentals sound, one formal trigger phrase outside the active trigger list).
**Follow-ups:**
- Tomorrow (Fri) is DOCS mode, not POLISH — issue #6 (`8d-problem-solving-builder.skill`, the last W20 target) will not get an autonomous POLISH pass this week. Flagging so the W21 PLAN either re-lists it or a human picks it up; otherwise #6 closes the week unworked.
- **Suite-wide pattern confirmed (3/3):** every POLISH pass this week — #3 hara ("safety goal"), #4 cs-concept ("CSR derivation"/"CAL allocation"), #5 aspice ("v3.1/v4.0") — found a canonical trigger phrase living outside the active trigger list. W21 PLAN should make a scripted once-per-week trigger-coverage audit across all 76 builders a first-class target instead of catching one per Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday.
- Human review: if the proposed `aspice-assessment-builder` description rewrite looks right, ship it as a manual commit and close #5. Same posture as #3/#4.
- Repackaging note for a human pass: `aspice-assessment-builder.skill` carries a stray empty `.placeholder` file and is missing a v4.0 reference doc — both worth fixing the next time the archive is rebuilt.
- Issue #2 ("goodd") still needs Sunday TRIAGE — still too low-confidence to label.


## 2026-05-16 (autonomous run, RELEASE)

**Mode:** RELEASE
**Action:** Cut the first weekly snapshot. Created `RELEASES.md` with the `v2026.05.W20` section (highlights, grouped commits, skills inventory, open-issue snapshot, compare link), regenerated `STATUS.md`, and prepared the lightweight tag `v2026.05.W20` to point at this commit. No `git push --force`, no GitHub Release object — per spec, the human clicks Publish after reviewing `RELEASES.md`.
**Files touched:**
- `STATUS.md` (regenerated — same 152 skill files, same paired ratio 76/76, header date bumped and the "RELEASE mode" suffix added)
- `RELEASES.md` (new)
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (alias map unchanged)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3 hara, #4 cs-concept, #5 aspice serviced this week awaiting close-out, #6 8d carries to W21)
**Notes:** Weekly commit count was non-zero (4 commits Mon→Fri: 1 plan + 3 polish), so the release was cut rather than skipped. Tag chosen as `v2026.05.W20` — ISO week 20 matches the W20 marker the polish/plan commits have been using all week, so the naming convention stays internally consistent. The compare link uses `3c69553...v2026.05.W20` (the last commit before this week's window → the tag). The grouping in RELEASES.md keeps `auto(plan):` and `auto(polish):` as the only two buckets because that is what the week actually produced — no `feat:` / `fix:` headers to surface. Open-issue list captured verbatim from the API. Issue #2 still flagged as needs-human; nothing in the suite-wide trigger-coverage pattern (3/3 polish passes finding the same shape) is acted on here because that belongs in the next PLAN pass, not in a release commit.
**Follow-ups:**
- After push, confirm the tag is visible on GitHub and click Publish on `v2026.05.W20` once the human has skimmed RELEASES.md.
- Tomorrow (Sun) is TRIAGE — service issue #2 with the "needs human triage" treatment (don't label below 80% confidence), and add the 30+-day quiet comment to anything stale (currently nothing in the open set is 30+ days old, so this should be a near-no-op).
- W21 PLAN on Monday should land the scripted suite-wide trigger-coverage audit that the three POLISH passes this week have been pointing at, plus carry forward `8d-problem-solving-builder.skill` (issue #6) since it didn't get a POLISH pass this week.
- Watch for future weeks where a `feat:` or `fix:` lands so RELEASES.md grouping starts exercising those buckets — current template handles them but they have not appeared yet.


## 2026-05-16 (autonomous run, RELEASE — same-day re-run, no-op release)

**Mode:** RELEASE (re-run)
**Action:** Detected that today's scheduled RELEASE pass already executed earlier (commit `766d56f` at 10:26 UTC: tag `v2026.05.W20` cut, `RELEASES.md` opened, STATUS regenerated, journal entry written). Per spec — "Confirm via `git tag -l` that it doesn't exist" — skipped re-tagging. Per spec — "ALWAYS commit at least one commit per run" — this journal entry is the commit content. STATUS.md was regenerated as a sanity check; the diff surfaced two classifier disagreements (`msa-gage-rr-builder` and `safety-plan-builder`) between this run's strict-spec-style classifier and the prior agent's classifier. Rather than ship a same-day STATUS that flips established domain labels, the regenerated STATUS was reverted and the disagreement is logged for human review (see follow-ups).
**Files touched:**
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` (this entry — sole commit content)
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired (alias map unchanged: `item-definition-builder ↔ item-def-checklist-reviewer`, `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer`)
**Open issues:** 5 (#2 untriaged + #3 hara, #4 cs-concept, #5 aspice serviced this week, #6 8d carries to W21 — identical to the 10:26 UTC run)
**Notes:** Two scheduled runs landed on the same calendar day. The first run handled the week's real release work correctly (RELEASES.md `v2026.05.W20` section is intact, tag exists, push succeeded). This second run had no new release work to do and consciously did not re-tag, did not append another section to RELEASES.md, and did not bump the STATUS header. A small classifier honesty problem also surfaced: re-reading the spec, `safety-*` is the safety domain prefix, which means `safety-plan-builder` should classify as `safety`, not `program-mgmt` (prior) and not `other` (my naive regex). The spec's quality list (`apqp/dfmea/pfmea/ppap/control-plan`) likewise omits `msa-`, `5-why`, `8d-`, `spc-` — so under a literal read most of the "quality" rows are actually "other". Both classifiers (prior and today's) drift from the spec in opposite directions. Not unilaterally re-labeling 10+ rows in a same-day re-run; flagging for the W21 PLAN to land a canonical classifier as a first-class target.
**Follow-ups:**
- W21 PLAN (Mon) should add a target: "freeze the STATUS classifier — write `scripts/classify_skill.py` that implements the spec literally, with explicit override entries for the (currently 2) names where a literal read produces a worse answer than human judgement". Until that lands, the existing STATUS body is the canonical reference, not the spec text.
- Verify tomorrow's TRIAGE run still sees `v2026.05.W20` on origin and that the human has had a chance to click Publish on the GitHub Release.
- No action on issues this run (TRIAGE is the right venue, not RELEASE re-run).
- Worth a one-line note on the human side: scheduled task fired twice today. If that was unintentional, the cadence-runner config probably needs a "skip if already ran today" guard.

## 2026-05-17 (autonomous run, TRIAGE)

**Mode:** TRIAGE
**Action:** Bootstrapped full label taxonomy (17 new labels), triaged 5 open issues, regenerated STATUS.md, fixed one missing-pair alias.
**Files touched:** STATUS.md, docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md
**Tests:** N/A (no test suite in this repo yet)
**Skill count:** 76 builders / 76 reviewers / 100.0% paired
**Open issues:** 5 (4 weekly-target, 1 needs-triage)
**Notes:** Added the issue-type labels (skill-bug, reviewer-finding, description-quality, new-skill, docs, ci, chain-break, needs-triage) plus the missing domain labels (autosar, comms, diagnostics, calibration, mbse, sysml, vv, program-mgmt, sotif) so future triage runs have somewhere to write. Issues #3-#6 are the W20 weekly targets and were already correctly labeled by Monday's PLAN run — no relabel needed; #3 hara, #4 cs-concept, #5 aspice-assessment were polished earlier this week per commit log; #6 (8d-problem-solving) is still outstanding. Issue #2 ("goodd", empty body) flagged `needs-triage` with a short comment surfacing it for human review — confidence well below 80% to bucket it as bug vs new-skill vs invalid. Only classifier change this run: added the alias `ppap-package-builder ↔ ppap-checklist-reviewer` (irregular file naming, factual missing-pair fix that takes paired ratio from 75/76 to 76/76). I also briefly added `msa-*`/`spc-*` to the quality domain regex, then reverted it: yesterday's RELEASE re-run explicitly deferred all domain reclassification to the W21 PLAN, and respecting that deferral matters more than a 2-row cosmetic improvement. STATUS body is therefore identical to yesterday in every cell except the one previously-🔴 ppap-package row, which is now 🟢.
**Follow-ups:**
- W21 PLAN (Mon) should add a target: "freeze the STATUS classifier — write `scripts/classify_skill.py` implementing the spec literally with an explicit override table for irregular names (`item-definition`, `ppap-package` already in the alias map)". This is the third TRIAGE/RELEASE entry in a row flagging classifier drift; it's overdue.
- 8d-problem-solving polish (issue #6) carries from W20 to W21.
- Issue #2 needs a human glance — close as invalid or expand body.
- Consider a CONTRIBUTING.md section documenting the label taxonomy now that it's complete.

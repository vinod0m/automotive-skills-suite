## v2026.05.W20 — 2026-05-16

ISO week 20 (2026-05-11 → 2026-05-16). First weekly snapshot of the autonomous run cadence.

### Highlights

- Three builders moved from "shipped" to "reviewed against the polish playbook": `hara-builder`, `cs-concept-builder`, `aspice-assessment-builder`. Each now carries a dated entry in `docs/skill-polish-log/` with severity-rated findings.
- Weekly target file `docs/weekly/WEEK-2026-W20.md` opened the loop on Monday and the four GitHub issues it spawned are now mostly serviced; one (`8d-problem-solving-builder`) carries forward to W21.
- Suite still at 76 builder + 76 reviewer pairs, 100% paired (`item-definition-builder` ↔ `item-def-checklist-reviewer` and `ppap-package-builder` ↔ `ppap-checklist-reviewer` are alias pairs and now reflected correctly in STATUS).

### Changes this week

### Notes for the human

Click Publish on the v2026.05.W20 tag on GitHub once you've skimmed this section. Issue #2 (`goodd`) is the one item Sunday's TRIAGE pass should probably still escalate to you — autonomous run is intentionally not labeling or commenting it because confidence is well below 80%.

## v2026.05.W21 — 2026-05-23

ISO week 21 (2026-05-18 → 2026-05-23). Second weekly snapshot — W21 polish cycle closed; CHANGELOG and the first `examples/` doc stubs landed.

### Highlights

- W21 polish ran the full Tue/Wed/Thu cadence over `8d-problem-solving-builder`, `dbc-builder`, and `autosar-swc-builder`; the autosar-swc pass shipped an actual in-allowlist description fix, the other two produced severity-rated polish-log findings held for human review.
- `CHANGELOG.md` introduced and the first `examples/<skill>/README.md` stubs added — the repo now has a docs spine beyond STATUS.
- Suite steady at 76 builder + 76 reviewer pairs, 100% paired; no flag changes vs. W20.

### Changes this week

**plan**
- `3320c23` auto(plan): W21 targets — 8d carryover, dbc, autosar-swc, uds-services, classifier-freeze

**polish**
- `e8ff3b2` auto(polish): W21 #6 8d-problem-solving-builder pass, regen STATUS.md
- `76b2fff` auto(polish): W21 #7 dbc-builder pass, regen STATUS.md
- `387bbcd` auto(polish): W21 #8 autosar-swc-builder pass — description fix applied, STATUS regen

**docs**
- `1a5ca80` auto(docs): add CHANGELOG, W21 example README stubs, regen STATUS

**docs / release** _(this snapshot commit)_
- STATUS.md refreshed (no flag changes vs. prior run)
- RELEASES.md updated with the W21 section
- CHANGELOG.md `[Unreleased]` rolled into a dated `[v2026.05.W21]` section
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` updated with the RELEASE-mode entry

### Skills inventory

- Builders: **76** · Reviewers: **76** · Paired ratio: **100.0%** (76/76)
- Domain spread: safety 14, quality 8, comms 8, program-mgmt 6, cyber 6, autosar 5, diagnostics 5, v&v 5, aspice 4, sysml 4, calibration 3, mbse 3, sotif 3, other 2

### Compare

### Open items for the human

- 10 issues open. Issue **#2** ("goodd", empty body) has stayed `needs-triage` across multiple runs — needs a human decision (likely close as spam/invalid).
- Issue **#11** ("packaging utility for Claude-compatible skill exports") is still unlabeled — Sunday TRIAGE should label it.
- W21 polish target **#9** (`uds-services-builder`) and tooling target **#10** (classifier freeze) were not serviced this week — both carry to W22.

## v2026.05.W22 — 2026-05-30

ISO week 22 (2026-05-25 → 2026-05-30). Third weekly snapshot — W22 polish cycle closed, alias map landed in the STATUS regen helper, RELEASE cadence now three weeks running.

### Highlights

- W22 polish ran the Tue/Wed/Thu cadence over `uds-services-builder`, `dfmea-builder`, and `hara-builder`; the uds-services pass shipped an in-allowlist description rewrite (DIDs, RIDs, SecurityAccess, NRC, P2/P2*/S3 timing, three session types, 0x10-0x86 service range, casual phrasings, sibling redirects) and finally cleared the W21-era classifier blind spot. The other two produced severity-rated polish-log entries held for human review.
- The reviewer-name alias map (`item-definition` ↔ `item-def`, `ppap-package` ↔ `ppap`) was promoted from inline override into the STATUS regen helper on Fri DOCS, so the 100% paired headline is now data-driven rather than hand-patched per run.
- Three new `examples/<skill>/README.md` stubs landed (uds-services, hara, dfmea) bringing the docs spine to seven seeded skills. CHANGELOG groups today's W22 work cleanly into Polish (3) and Docs (1 plan + 1 docs commit).
- Suite steady at 76 builder + 76 reviewer pairs, 100% paired; no flag changes vs. W21.

### Changes this week

**plan**
- `973c075` auto(plan): W22 targets — uds, hara, cs-concept, aspice-assessment, dfmea

**polish**
- `9850780` auto(polish): W22 #1 uds-services-builder pass, regen STATUS
- `04482aa` auto(polish): W22 #5 dfmea-builder pass, regen STATUS, journal
- `ef78172` auto(polish): W22 #2 hara-builder pass, regen STATUS, journal

**docs**
- `f9e63f9` auto(docs): W22 changelog roll-up, 3 example stubs, STATUS regen

**docs / release** _(this snapshot commit)_
- STATUS.md refreshed (no flag changes vs. prior run; 76/76 paired)
- RELEASES.md updated with the W22 section
- CHANGELOG.md `[Unreleased]` rolled into a dated `[v2026.05.W22]` section
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md` updated with the RELEASE-mode entry

### Skills inventory

- Builders: **76** · Reviewers: **76** · Paired ratio: **100.0%** (76/76)
- Domain spread: safety 13, other 9, comms 8, cyber 6, autosar 5, diagnostics 5, quality 5, v&v 5, aspice 4, sysml 4, calibration 3, mbse 3, program-mgmt 3, sotif 3

### Compare

### Open items for the human

- 10 issues open. The five W22-touched targets (#3 hara, #4 cs-concept, #5 aspice-assessment, #9 uds-services, #12 dfmea) now all carry W22 polish-log evidence — recommend a sweep to close the ones the human considers done.
- Issue **#10** (classifier freeze) is now 7+ runs old; this week's Fri DOCS pass got the alias map into the helper but the helper is still inline-Python in each commit. Mon W23 PLAN should allocate a tooling slot to extract `scripts/classify_skill.py`.
- Issue **#11** (skill packaging utility) and the W22 carryover targets (cs-concept, aspice-assessment, which only have W20-dated polish-log entries) are the natural W23 candidates if the human wants visible motion next week.
